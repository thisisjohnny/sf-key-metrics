# Key Metrics Lightning Web Component

This Key Metrics component allows you to display certain key fields more visually appealing than through using Compact Layouts and the standard Highlights Pannel. The advantage here as well is that multiple components with multiple configurations can be added to the same record page. The component takes advantage of custom metadata types for the configuration of the component, allowing you to package the settings for distribution. Only colors have remained options directly from the Lightning App Builder to allow admins the ability to view changes in color on the fly. If no colors are modified, the component will default to using a preset palette based off of the Salesforce "Lightning Ridge" Themes and Branding option.
