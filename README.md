This Key Metrics component allows you to display certain key fields in a more visually appealing way than through using Compact Layouts and the standard Highlights Pannel. The advantage here as well is that multiple components with multiple configurations can be added to the same record page. The component takes advantage of custom metadata types for the configuration of the component, allowing you to package the settings for distribution. Only colors have remained options directly from the Lightning App Builder to allow admins the ability to view changes on the fly. If no colors are modified, the component will default to using a preset palette based off of the Salesforce "Lightning Ridge" Themes and Branding option.

## What To Do

### Deploy this package
1. Deploy this package to your Salesforce environment, use the [Salesforce DX Public Deployer](https://hosted-scratch.herokuapp.com/byoo?template=https://github.com/thisisjohnny/sf-key-metrics) and choose the option best for you 
2. Go to Settings > Custom Metadata Types and click the _Manage Records_ action link next to the _Key Metrics Setting_ label
3. Click New to create your new configuration. (Reference the Example Settings included as a starting point if needed.)
4. Add the component to any Lightning Record Page
5. Drag the Key Metrics custom component to your Lightning App Builder canvas and set the Custom Metadata Label information. (Note: This is not case sensitive)
6. Save and Activate your page

### Custom Metadata Types explained
Rather than using property fields on the component settings of a Lightning App Builder page, this component uses Custom Metadata Types to hold most of the configurations for the component. There are a few benefits to this method, but primarily it allows you to easily package the configuration for distribution. Configuring the Metadata record is much like creating any other record in Salesforce. See the screen shot above for a visual, or reference the existing Example Settings record included in this package.

The Card Format allows for four options: 1, 2, 3, and 4-up configurations‚Äîmeaning the component will render at minimum 1 and at most 4 metrics at a time. This is to help ensure the metrics have enough space to 'breathe' in the interface. If you would like to include more than four metrics on a single record page, create multiple custom metadata type records and include the Key Metrics component on the page as many times as needed.

Each Card has options for how to render types of metrics.
- Currency metrics can display the symbol ($), the code (USD), or the name (Dollars).
- Additionally you can determine the notation of currency metrics to be standard ($3,500) or compact ($3.5K).
- Number metrics can also have a notation for decimal values only with an added option for scientific notation (3.5E6).
- Date metrics have a few options for how to render the year, month, day, and weekday (optional). Check the [documentation](http://sfdc.co/date-component) for full details and a playground to preview different options.

For each metric, you need to provide the following information:
1. **Metric Label**: This component allows for flexibility in naming the label for your metric rather than pulling from the metadata of the org schema itself. E.g. If the field label in your org is ‚ÄúApproved Quote Lines with Discount‚Äù, the metric label in the component configuration can simply be ‚ÄúApproved Discounts‚Äù.
2. **Metric API Name**: This is the API name of the field you would like to render in the component. As with the Object API Name, you will need to include the `__c` suffix for any custom fields.
3. **Metric Format**: This is needed to determine how to render the field in the component. Similiarly, this is left open to change for flexibility reasons should the field be stored in a different format than how you'd like it rendered on the screen. This is a picklist field with limited options.

### Background and color settings explained
This component renders each metric included in the configuration iteratively with its own child component. Child components inherit the display settings from the parent component available for update via the Lightning App Builder or Experience Builder. There are three options available for configuring how the component is displayed:
1. **Card Background Color**: Uses the CSS `background` element. This setting accepts CSS color names (e.g. `aliceblue`), HEX values (e.g. `#F0F8FF`), and RGB values (`rgb(240, 248, 255)`). Additionally, more advanced CSS styling can be applied to the background, such as gradient fills (`radial-gradient(circle, rgba(12,43,62,1) 0%, rgba(19,72,103,1) 40%, rgba(23,87,125,1) 100%)`). With great power comes great responsibility and browser compatibility concerns.
2. **Metric Text Color**: Uses the CSS `color` element. This setting accepts CSS color names, HEX values, and RGB values.
3. **Metric Label Color**: Uses the CSS `color` element. This setting accepts CSS color names, HEX values, and RGB values.

As with all color choices throughout any of your applications, do consider accessibility when choosing colors. Backgrounds and metric text should have high contrast to be easily visible. However, regardless of contrast, colors should be comfortable enough to look at for a longer period of time (i.e. Avoid black text on a background of something such as `lime` (`#00FF00`, `rgb(0,255,0)`)).
